# UBNTPlanner
UBNT Planning Tool

This is a small program that is designed to help people plan a Ubiquiti equipment install.

This program is NOT: 
*an accurate way to calculate signal
*an accurate way to determin where and what equipment is needed
*an program that makes a pretty image of your install

I hope this program becomes of use to people.

Please feel free to express new ideas and tell me about bugs.

Thank you,
Trevor Flynn
